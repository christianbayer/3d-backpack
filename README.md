# 3D Backpack
3D modeling of a backpack, made with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), integrated with [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) into [La Redoute](https://www.laredoute.com/)'s website. This was a work done for the discipline of Graphic Systems and Interaction, from the [Polytechnic Institute of Leiria](https://www.ipleiria.pt/), Portugal.
